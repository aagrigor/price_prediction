regression - predicting prices

In this repo I am building a regression model to predict house prices

I am using Python with sklearn and experimenting with the following models:
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor


File predict_house_prices.ipynb shows how to work with pandas, do some feature engineering and how to prepare models.
